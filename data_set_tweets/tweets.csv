Getting from A to B routinely -&gt; dress for work. Safe.

More head injuries as pedestrian, passenger or driver .. or taking a bath or a shower.

Kashyap continues to rally in the second game and wins a couple of good points but Momota still leads 11-7 at the break. The world champ is not in top gear but is managing to stay ahead of his opponent. #Badminton",badminton
The Field,0,"#KoreaOpenSuper500

Kashyap closes the gap to just 2 points but Momota finds goes into the interval with a 4-point lead. The commentator, however, seems to think Momota is not 100% at the moment. Can Kashyap keep this momentum going?
